### What is that?
This is a chrome extension very useful for myself to mark as read all sites I've visited.

### Why does it exist?
I am an active english learner, so every day I try to learn at least 5 new expressions. The method that I've been using is: I visit some dictionary, and I start looking for new english expressions, and then I add them to my [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

This is great because I avoid repetition of expressions.
